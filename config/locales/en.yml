          APPLICATION ON ALREADY HIGHLIGHTENED HAIR:
          The color results of MAGMA /89, MAGMA /39, MAGMA /36 can be too intensive
          on very light/previously colored hair. In such cases always color the dark
          untreated parts of the hair first and then emulsify the color through
          the already lightened hair for the last 5 minutes of the development time.
          If the above recommendations are not followed the tone can become too intensive.
          To achieve optimum color results the use of MAGMA hair color is recommended
          on hair colored evenly from roots to ends.
